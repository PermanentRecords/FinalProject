<h1 align="center">Andrew's History of Guitar</h1>
<img src="images/andrewgtr.jpg" alt="A teenaged Andrew playing his Vantage guitar." width="350" height="350" align="right" /><p class="tab">I got my first guitar on December 25th, 1992. I was ten years old, with my birthday only one month away. I had been playing trumpet for a few years and before that I had been playing the recorder in band class, but I had decided early on that I would prefer to play an instrument that I could use in a group setting. Not many people find a reason to continue playing an orchestral instrument after high school, and I loved music with a passion. I knew it was going to be a lifelong affair, and wanted easy access to it. Guitar seemed the best choice, piano isn’t as portable and bass guitar seemed too easy to my uneducated mind. Drums were obnoxiously loud. Guitar it was.</p>
<p class="tab">My first axe was a brand from Taiwan called Vantage. Mine in particular was from the upper end of the company’s offerings, having a lot of options, 24 frets, and a real Floyd Rose whammy bar, not a Floyd-Licensed knock off. It was poorly set up, hard to play, and the amplifier it came with was crackly and intermittent. Still, it was awesome, with a dark green translucent finish that showed the wood grain beneath and cream coloured binding. I was never ungrateful for the presents I got, knowing that my family was not well off. It was something to learn on and I was eager. </p>
<p class="tab">I got a book with it, a songbook that I worked with that left me confused. I knew the notes, and the book showed how to play chords and then had a short section of a popular song that used those chords. Unfortunately it showed the music notation for the vocal melody and had a lead sheet format, showing where and when to play the chords in relation to the vocals. Without instruction, it probably wasn’t a good book to learn from. I did learn how to finger the chords from the book but not in any sort of context. I worked on it for a few months, and also a few selections from my favourite bands. At the time they were Metallica, ZZ Top, and Pink Floyd. Not exactly the popular music of a ten year old, but my father was into classic rock and I had a thirst for metal.</p>
<p class="tab">After about a year, I realized that I could play a part of just about everything but had yet to string together an entire song. So I set my sights on a difficult piece (for a now-11 year old) as my first complete tune. A fingerpicked Metallica song, Nothing Else Matters. I should mention that I hadn’t done any fingerpicking yet. As a matter of fact, I hadn’t even changed my strings yet. For months I struggled with the verse part. Hidden under the vocals in the recording, there was no clear way to hear the guitar isolated and it was in an odd time signature (6/8) instead of the usual 4/4 most of the rock music I had been playing up to that point had been in. Over and over I practiced the part until I could get the notes to play in the correct order - the amount of finger movement I was doing seemed impossible, but then one day it all just fell together.</p>
<h2 align="center">Recording</h2>
<p class="tab">There was a time, I think I was around 16 years old, that I felt like I wasn’t progressing. But other people said I was getting good. How could I track my progress? I tried hearing the improvements but it felt so gradual if there were any that I’d never be able to hear it while I was concentrating on my playing. So I went out and I bought a little Tascam cassette based 4 track recorder. Boy, did that open a lot of doors for me. That was how it started. Soon the headphone jack output from my tiny guitar amp didn’t sound good enough so I bought a microphone to put in front of my amp. I marvelled at how tiny changes in angle and distance from the speaker made huge changes in the timbre of the sound. You can practically equalize something by mic placement alone, and make things sound bigger by moving the mic away from the source or smaller by getting in close. I noticed that the tighter you get to the source the less outside sounds get into the mic, and the tighter the sound becomes. I also realized the opposite - pulling it back resulted in a fuller sound, but captured more of the environment. I tried different locations and this only brightened the lightbulb above my head… different sounding locations can greatly enhance or detract from the sound. I had an epiphany:</p>
<p align="center">Recording music was as much an art as playing it.</p>
<p class="tab">With this knowledge, I began amassing a collection of microphones from the Long and McQuade brand, Apex. They had the look of the expensive microphones, and I didn’t really understand that they didn’t capture the tone in the same way as something more professional. Being a loner, I spent many hours reading and researching audio. I became very book smart on theory, technique, and application of audio equipment including recording technology of the time, microphones, wiring… it seemed like my head was going to explode. I was so full of knowledge. But I had yet to put it into proper practice. I had a 4 track cassette recorder that could only add one track at a time. <i>I needed <b>more</b></i>.</p>
<p class="tab">I expanded my setup to be able to record 18 mics at once, and put myself in considerable debt doing it. New soundcard, new computer, even a nicer computer screen to make it happen. But then right when things started getting exciting, I was robbed for over $12, 000 of equipment. I just happened to have lent out a guitar amp and had my prized Gibson Flying V with me when it happened, so I wasn’t completely cleared out.</p>
<p class="tab">This robbery happened to be a blessing in a way. The insurance company agreed to write it over to Long and McQuade as a dollar amount for the replacement value instead of replacing the gear. This time around, I made better decisions regarding microphones specifically, and decided that I would focus on excellent mics and mic amplifiers, and do all my effects in the computer - a decision I still am glad I made to this day.</p>
