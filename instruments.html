<h1 align="center">The Instruments that Changed My Life</h1>
<br>
<p class="tab">I’m not going to go through all the instruments I own or have owned, but I will discuss the ones that changed my life or have an interesting story.</p>
<br>
<a href="images/v.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/vthumb.jpg" alt="Gibson Custom Shop Flying V" align="right"/></a><h2 align="center">Gibson Custom Shop Flying V</h2>
<p class="tab">This guitar has the longest history with me, and the best back story. You see, in 1998 I had a black Squire Stratocaster. The Stratocaster is one of the most recognizable and common shapes in the world. Squire guitars are cheap. There were probably 100,000 of them in Vancouver, British Columbia alone. So I wanted to upgrade my guitar, so I brought my black boring old budget Strat into my local Long and McQuade. It was mid afternoon on a weekend, and the store was bustling. They took the guitar away, and told me it was being appraised. Whatever. Mint condition budget strat, I was expecting $50 towards my new guitar, a $2200 custom flying V. I started getting impatient after 20 minutes. After 40 I was getting a little angry. Suddenly, in front of the whole store, I was surrounded by police officers and handcuffed. How embarrassing. I was put in a closet for several hours as they tried to trace the history of this guitar I was selling, with my hands handcuffed behind my back.</p>
<p class="tab">Unfortunately, the store I bought it from had been purchased from L&M and all their (at the time) paper records had been packed up and put into storage. I sat, every wiggle clicking my handcuffs tighter, for hours. Eventually they found the original bill of sale, apologized, and let me go. Offered me slightly more than I was expecting on the strat. I was so angry!</p>
<p class="tab">I went home and sent a scathing email to the store manager, which got a swift apology email and a promise to make things right by offering a deep discount on anything I wanted. I ended up getting half off a custom Gibson Guitar - a Flying V, built to my specs. A big fat neck, african mahogany, a real ebony fingerboard. All satin black, with a black pickguard, black knobs, black hardware. A picture of Orville Gibson just because it was an option on the back of the headstock. Mystical star with a moon around it as the only fret marker. I thought I was a badass. I ended up adding skull knobs and I hand made a diamond plate pickguard which tarnished quickly and added to the industrial look I was going for.</p>
<p class="tab">Looking back, I was a dumb kid and should have gone for the throat. That guitar should have been free.</p>
<br>
<a href="images/bird.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/birdthumb.jpg" alt="Gibson Hummingbird" align="left"/></a><h2 align="center">Gibson Hummingbird</h2>
<p class="tab"> It was 2017, June or July. I was getting severly crushing headaches and had excess money. I went to my local L&M and I ordered a Gibson Hummingbird, the guitar I had been lusting over since 1996. It was a piece of garbage. I ordered a different one. Same deal. When I looked originally, it was about $1100, and then when I went to the store to buy one in 2002 it was $1400 - when I finally bought it in 2017, it was $3500. You can blame inflation all you want, that’s just straight up bullshit. When you spend that kind of money on an instrument, you can afford to be that picky. It had better be perfect, and mine is.</p>
<p class="tab">It’s such a great guitar, that I don’t feel ripped off one penny.</p>
<br>
<a href="images/bh.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/bhthumb.jpg" alt="Gibson BluesHawk" align="right"/></a><h2 align="center">Gibson BluesHawk</h2>
<p class="tab">This is a great guitar. I love all of mine, but none of them were ever such a deal, and I almost passed it by. It was December 27th, 2004. I was up really early so that I could get to the Boxing Week Sale first. I stepped outside, locking the door behind me. My keys were inside, but someone would be awake to let me in by the time I got home. My phone beeped. My friends were not coming. It was just after 6am, it was wintertime, and I was locked out of my house. I went alone and annoyed. I arrived shortly after 7 am, first in line for the 10 am start. I sat there, freezing, having to pee, for hours. The next person in line didn’t show until almost 930 am. I was awarded a gift card for being first in line at the sale, and combined with the money and gift cards I had received for Christmas, this Gibson guitar cost me less than $200 out of my own pocket. And I even talked them into giving me a free gig bag because I was catching the bus home and I wanted to protect it from the elements.</p>

<a href="images/lpb.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/lpbthumb.jpg" alt="Gibson Les Paul Studio Bass" align="left"/></a><h2 align="center">Gibson Les Paul Studio Bass</h2>
<p class="tab">I wandered into the local Long and McQuade one day and saw it - a red Gibson bass. Red is my favourite colour. I needed a quality bass even though I am not much of a bassist, it really is a nice tool to have. It was on for half price and I scooped it up immediately. I didn’t notice the damage on it in the store, but I did manage to get them to throw in a case for it. It’s got a very long scale that I actually find uncomfortable because I’m so short. </p>
<p class="tab">The bass came at a good time. My friend was in an up and coming band, and he was also an aspiring electrician who decided to try smaller wiring jobs on his own bass guitar; he ended up wrecking his own bass shortly before a gig, and borrowed mine. The gig went well. I like to think that it was due to my sweet bass, but afterward I heard that his bandmates were making fun of him for playing it. “Gibsons are for stupid old men with more money than sense,” they told him. He was annoyed because he had really enjoyed playing it and was considering his own.</p>
<p class="tab">Unfortunately it has had a re-fret sometime in it’s life (I got it used) and it was not a pretty one. The edge binding around the fingerboard is blown out on almost every fret. The neck had a twist to it that took many hours to correct. Now it plays like a dream, and before it played nice but had some pretty deep intonation issues. The edge of the neck is unfortunately still ugly, but at least it’s only cosmetic.</p>

<a href="images/strat.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/stratthumb.jpg" alt="Squire Bullet Stratocaster" align="right"/></a><h2 align="center">Squire Bullet Stratocaster</h2>
<p class="tab">This guitar is a piece of crap. It literally comes in around $100. Why do I have it and play it almost as much as my favourite electric guitars? Firstly, it has very light strings. They are 9’s, basically loose shoelaces flopping around on the fingerboard. I can shred all day at blistering speeds on this. It doesn’t sound good, but it’s fun to play. The tone is plinky at best, and if I fret too hard it goes out of tune. It looks like it should have a whammy bar but it doesn’t.</p>
<p class="tab">What it does have is a Roland midi pickup installed on it, and I use it to orchestrate and write MIDI data. Each string can be programmed individually, and often I have every string or pair of strings a seperate or group of instruments, pitched up or down. A good example would be the lower 2 strings doing cello, pitched down an octave; the lowest 3 strings doing viola; middle 4 strings doing violin, top 3 strings doing harp, and the top 2 strings doing harp up an octave for a fairly full sounding string section from an orchestra. It’s fast for me to write a part, and play it into my recording software this way. One pass recording can give me a whole section of an orchestra at a time! 3 or 4 runs through and I can have a magnum opus, and the best part is every group of instruments is recorded as a seperate midi channel and can be exported as sheet music for real musicians to play if the sample libraries are not good enough for a particular project.</p>
<p class="tab">It’s totally possible that I could have installed the Roland MIDI pickup on a better guitar, but it is SO UGLY that I didn’t want to marr the beauty of my finer instruments. My guitars are not only tools - they are art and I keep them in excellent condition and on display when not playing. I am a rare breed, and I think that the case is for transport and not storage. My guitars are out in the living room, in my bedroom, in stands, and up on the wall. </p>

<a href="images/guild.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/guildthumb.jpg" alt="Guild GAD 40-C" align="left"/></a><h2 align="center">Guild GAD 40-C</h2>
<p class="tab">Here I was, two thousand dollars in cash, at Long and McQuade. The guitar I wanted, the Gibson Hummingbird, was in sight, beautifully presented in a fine glass display case. I asked the employees to open up the case and get it out like I had done a hundred times before. This time I was so excited to buy it in cash, because I was quite young and it was a very nice and expensive instrument.</p>
<p class="tab">As happens often in my life, this is where the tragedy struck. After a long time of waiting for them to open up, an employee came to me and announced that they couldn’t find the keys. I said I could wait. I started playing different guitars off the wall. For a good 45 minutes I played everything I could and then I tried a Guild with a cutaway. It played so nicely and had a shimmering beautiful tone. It was a great guitar - and only half the price of the Hummingbird. The ‘bird was clearly the better guitar - but was it twice as good? I walked out of that store with the Guild, a fine instrument - and regretted it for 20 years.Why was I so harsh on it? The only reason I can think of is that it wasn’t what I wanted. To this day it gets the same amount of play as the Hummingbird, and they are both different tools that are actually a fine complement to each other.</p>

<p class="tab">This instrument was on a sale at Long-McQuade that I used to go to every year. It was at one location only, where they got all the rental stock from the Vancouver area and liquidated it at the Surrey location. It was dubbed the Surrey Summer Garage Sale and I believe I acquired this fine 12-string acoustic guitar for $250 dollars. That’s less than half of what it would be new, and although it doesn’t have a case it fits in either of my other acoustic guitar cases nicely even though the headstock is very long.</p>
<p class="tab">There’s something about mine in particular that sets it apart from other 12 strings in the same price range. This guitar sparkles, but respectfully so. It doesn’t have a piercing shimmer to it but the lows are low and the tone even throughout the entire audio range. I have played much more expensive instruments through the years that don’t perform as well as this one does. Furthermore, it has an active electronics section that includes an equalizer and volume control. It unfortunately is quite large compared to more modern acoustic guitar electronics, so a large hole has been cut in the upper bout.</p>
<p class="tab">This guitar has been a staple for me for the past 20 years and I am losing the hand strength required to play 12 strings. But I do play it in short bursts, and enjoy it when I do.</p>
