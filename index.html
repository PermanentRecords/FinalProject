<h1 align="center">About</h1>
<p class="tab">This webpage is a small example of the things I learned in the ComIT course. It's been very educational and although this is not the most exciting website ever seen it still was programmed entirely by me. I decided to make a small site to showcase what life has een like for me, as a musician for nearly 30 years.</p>
<p class="tab">Through the course I learned the fundamentals of html, CSS, and Javascript and although there was a heavy focus on NodeJS, GitBash, and other tools, I feel like we only really scratched the surface on these more advanced tools. The most useful skill I think I learned during the course was to correctly identify the problem so that I could search for a solution and hopefully learn from it. Repitition seems to be the key to being a successful programmer. I do think that I have a future as an amateur or hobbyist coder. I have created a few video games, combining my passion for 3d art, music, and sound with my basic coding skills to put together basic games that have received a pretty warm reception in the gaming community.</p>
<p class="tab">I plan on using my newfound abilities to make apps and games using Unity and C#. Although we didn't exactly cover C# in the course, I notice a similarity between different programming languages and my clearer understanding of the syntax required really helps. I now hold the belief that computers are actually quite dumb and need precise hand holding, very specific instructions presented in the correct order for them to obey. Knowing how to program seems less important than knowing how to find the relevant information online to better understand telling the cpu how to interpret the data to do what you want. Honestly it feels like cheating to rely so heavily on google, but as a few of my professional programmer friends say, everybody does it! And if it's a standard practice, I guess there's no shame in participating.</p>
<p class="tab">What I would love to work up to is learning how to assemble an application. Using Unity for games makes things very easy since it compiles everything for me down into an execuatable with many different output options. But to create apps for Google or Apple would be ideal - I have a very active imagination and I love tools. I use many apps on a frequent basis. I know I am a rarity, often buying apps instead of opting for the free ones, but I have a few ideas for some excellent apps that I would be happy to see for the price of a cup of coffee. Since I generally work in a technical position, I have a few different ideas for apps that would help people who are out in the field reference vital information.</p>
